---

Synchronize the GRACE shared artifacts with the actual codebase.

## Refresh Modes

Default to the narrowest scope that can still answer the drift question.

### `targeted` (default during active execution)

- scan only changed modules, touched imports, and directly affected dependency surfaces
- use when a controller already has wave results or graph delta proposals
- ideal after a clean multi-agent wave

### `full`

- scan the whole source tree
- use after refactors, manual edits across many modules, phase completion, or when targeted refresh finds suspicious drift

## Process

### Step 1: Choose Scope

Decide whether the refresh should be `targeted` or `full`.

1. If the caller provides changed files, module IDs, or graph delta proposals, start with `targeted`
2. If no reliable scope is available, or the graph may have drifted broadly, use `full`
3. Escalate from `targeted` to `full` when the localized scan reveals wider inconsistency

When the optional `grace` CLI is available, you may use `grace lint --path <project-root>` as a quick preflight before starting a broader refresh. Treat it as a hint source, not as the refresh itself.

You may also use:

- `grace module find <changed-path-or-query> --path <project-root>` to resolve the likely module scope from changed files or names
- `grace module show M-XXX --path <project-root> --with verification` to grab the shared/public contract, dependency, and verification context
- `grace file show <path> --path <project-root> --contracts --blocks` to inspect file-local/private details without rereading whole source files first

### Step 2: Scan the Selected Scope

For each file in scope, extract:

- MODULE_CONTRACT (if present)
- MODULE_MAP (if present)
- imports and exports
- CHANGE_SUMMARY (if present)
- nearby module-local test files, required log markers, and verification commands when available

Treat shared XML artifacts as public-surface documents:

- shared docs should track module boundaries, dependencies, verification refs, and public module interfaces
- private helpers and implementation-only types may exist in file headers without needing graph or plan entries

In `targeted` mode, also inspect the immediate dependency surfaces needed to validate CrossLinks accurately.

### Step 3: Compare with Shared Artifacts

Read `docs/knowledge-graph.xml` and, when present, `docs/verification-plan.xml`. Identify:

- **Missing modules**: files with MODULE_CONTRACT that are not in the graph
- **Orphaned modules**: graph entries whose files no longer exist in the scanned scope
- **Stale CrossLinks**: dependencies in the graph that do not match actual imports
- **Missing contracts**: files that should be governed by GRACE but have no MODULE_CONTRACT
- **Missing verification entries**: governed modules or tests with no corresponding `V-M-xxx` entry
- **Stale verification refs**: verification entries whose test files, commands, or required markers no longer match the scoped code
- **Escalation signals**: evidence that the problem extends beyond the scanned scope

Do not report drift just because a private helper exists in source but not in shared docs. Shared docs should only drift on public contract or dependency changes.

### Step 4: Report Drift

Present a structured report:

```text
GRACE Integrity Report
======================
Mode: targeted / full
Scope: [modules or files]
Synced modules: N
Missing from graph: [list files]
Orphaned in graph: [list entries]
Stale CrossLinks: [list]
Files without contracts: [list files]
Missing verification entries: [list modules]
Stale verification refs: [list entries]
Escalation: no / yes - reason
```

### Step 5: Fix (with user approval)

For each issue, propose a fix:

- Missing from graph - add an entry using the unique ID-based tag convention
- Orphaned - remove or repair the stale graph entry
- Stale links - update CrossLinks from actual imports
- No contracts - generate or restore the missing MODULE_CONTRACT from code analysis and plan context
- Missing verification entries - add or repair the matching `V-M-xxx` block in `docs/verification-plan.xml`
- Stale verification refs - update test files, commands, or required log markers from the real scoped code

When updating graph or plan artifacts, add only public module-facing annotations and interfaces. Keep private helper details local to the source file.

Ask the user for confirmation before applying fixes.

### Step 6: Update Shared Artifacts

Apply approved fixes to `docs/knowledge-graph.xml` and `docs/verification-plan.xml` as needed. Update versions only after the selected refresh scope is reconciled.

## Rules

- Do not scan the whole repository after every clean wave if a targeted refresh can answer the question
- Prefer controller-supplied graph delta proposals as hints, but validate them against real files
- Prefer controller-supplied verification delta proposals as hints, but validate them against real tests and commands
- Escalate to `full` whenever targeted evidence suggests broader drift
