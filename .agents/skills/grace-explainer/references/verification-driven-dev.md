# Verification-Driven Development

In GRACE, verification is not an afterthought. It is a maintained architectural artifact.

## Core Idea

`docs/verification-plan.xml` answers the question:

"How will another agent prove that this module or flow is still correct?"

That proof has three layers:

1. deterministic assertions for exact outcomes
2. trace or log assertions for execution trajectory
3. phase-level or integration checks for merged surfaces

For long autonomous runs, verification is also an autonomy gate. It must prove that another agent can continue or debug from the visible evidence instead of from hidden reasoning.

## Verification Plan Structure

Typical sections:

- `GlobalPolicy` - project-wide log format, redaction rules, and verification levels
- `CriticalFlows` - the high-risk product paths that must remain observable
- `ModuleVerification` - one `V-M-xxx` entry per important module
- `PhaseGates` - broader checks required before calling a phase done

## Module Verification Entry

Example:

```xml
<V-M-CHATS MODULE="M-CHATS" PRIORITY="high">
  <test-files>
    <file>apps/server/src/chat/index.test.ts</file>
  </test-files>
  <module-checks>
    <check-1>bun test apps/server/src/chat/index.test.ts</check-1>
  </module-checks>
  <scenarios>
    <scenario-1 kind="success">Generated title is assigned only when the chat is still untitled.</scenario-1>
    <scenario-2 kind="failure">Ownership failure rejects the mutation.</scenario-2>
  </scenarios>
  <required-log-markers>
    <marker-1>[ChatDomain][setGeneratedTitleIfEmpty][BLOCK_ASSIGN_GENERATED_TITLE]</marker-1>
  </required-log-markers>
</V-M-CHATS>
```

## Log-Driven Development

Logs are evidence, not decoration.

Good GRACE logs are:

- tied to semantic blocks
- structured with stable fields
- safe to retain and inspect
- precise enough that a future agent can navigate back to the source block or the failing scenario

Example:

```ts
logger.info('[ChatDomain][createChat][BLOCK_INSERT_CHAT] Chat created', {
  chatId,
  userId,
  correlationId,
});
```

## Test Design Rules

1. Deterministic assertions first.
2. Add trace or log assertions when a plain return-value check is not enough.
3. Keep module-local tests close to the module when practical.
4. Use narrow fakes and stubs rather than giant opaque mocks.
5. If a bug escaped, strengthen the nearby verification entry and tests before closing the loop.

## Execution Levels

- **Module level**: fast checks that a worker can run alone
- **Wave level**: checks for only the merged surfaces touched in the wave
- **Phase level**: broader regression and integrity gates

Execution packets in `grace-execute` and `grace-multiagent-execute` should reuse these levels instead of inventing new checks ad hoc.

## Autonomy Gate

Before sending a module to a longer autonomous run, check:

1. a `V-M-xxx` entry exists for the module
2. at least one module-local command exists
3. success and failure scenarios are named
4. required log markers or trace assertions make divergence observable
5. wave-level or phase-level follow-up is named when module-local checks are not enough
6. operational packets or checkpoint reports capture assumptions, stop conditions, and next action

## Failure Packets

When verification fails, capture:

- scenario that failed
- expected evidence
- observed evidence
- first divergent function or block
- next suggested action

This makes `grace-fix` faster and less lossy.
